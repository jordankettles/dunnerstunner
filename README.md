# dunner stunner Bot
A simple web scraping twitter bot for good weather in Dunedin, New Zealand. I used the python-twitter package to interface with the Twitter API.

The bot currently runs on the Google Cloud Functions Platform.

The twitter bot can be found here: [twitter.com/dunstunBot](https://twitter.com/dunstunBot)

## Defining a dunner stunner 
After countless hours of research and specialist training sitting outside in the sun with my flatmates, this is my definition of a dunner stunner.

- Firstly, it must not be raining during a dunner stunner.
- Secondly, a dunner stunner must have an outside temperature above a certain value.
- Finally, the outside temperature of a dunner stunner is dependent on the season.

|  Season  | Base Temperature |
| -------- |:----------------:|
|  Summer  |      20&deg      |
|  Autumn  |      15&deg      |
|  Winter  |      14&deg      |
|  Spring  |      15&deg      |
